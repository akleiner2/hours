Updating hours system 

## About the project

This project is being built on top of the Firebase API, using the jQuery library. It is intended as an easy way to update the statistics, hours, or any sort of information for any given person. This is made as a side project for one of the clubs I am involved in at school. 

If you have any questions about how it works, please feel free to reach out to me at:
